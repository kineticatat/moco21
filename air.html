     <h2>Artist-in-Residence (AiR) position via the 8th International Conference on Movement and Computing</h2>

     <p>The organizers of the 8th International Conference on Movement and Computing (MOCO 2021) invite applications for an Artist-in-Residence (AiR) for roughly March-September of 2021. </p>
     <p>MOCO is the international conference on movement and computing. MOCO aims to gather academics and practitioners interested in the computational study, modelling, representation, segmentation, recognition, classification, or generation of movement information. The conference references the challenge of representing embodied movement knowledge within computational models, yet it also celebrates the inherent expression available within movement as a language. While human movement itself focuses on bodily experience, developing computational models for movement requires abstraction and representation of lived embodied cognition. This conference seeks to explore an equal and richly nuanced epistemological partnership between movement experience and movement cognition and computational representation. </p>

     <p>The AiR will be invited to work with stakeholders in research, teaching, industry, and outreach as part of the 8th MOCO, which is currently planned for July 2021 at Columbia College in downtown Chicago, IL.  Initially, this will involve collaboration in grant writing, residency planning, and theme development, working alongside conference organizers.  Later on, this will involve the exploration of creation of new work alongside several groups of stakeholders, such as:  1) students at Columbia College Chicago, with on-campus residencies in the Spring and Fall 2021 terms, 2) researchers at MOCO, acting as a member of the organizing committee, 3) community members in Chicago, and  4) audience members at public and conference-oriented showings, potentially culminating in a premiere of new work.  Artists that demonstrate interest in all four categories will be the best fit for this position.</p>

     <p>The artist is asked to specifically address the conference theme of “Artificial Embodiment / Windy Shifts” in their proposal. This theme calls out the physical, embodied instantiations of computers like robots, wearable devices, and simulated avatars that attempt to bring the natural bodily experience of humans into computational technologies; moreover, the theme calls out the location of this year’s MOCO in the heart of the Midwest, which is an agricultural center that is often overlooked as a tech hub despite the vast use of automation, including in farming, in and around Chicago. The artist is invited to interpret this idea broadly.</p>

     <p>This position will be funded through industrial sponsorships, grants, conference registration fees, and institutional in-kind support.  In fulfilling this role, the AiR will:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>  Explore the creation of new work with the goal of showing work-in-progress at the mid and final point of the residency, in any format or medium; parameters and expectations surrounding the work are set by the artist </li>
   <li>  Work across disciplines and collaborate with engineers/scientists and artists/designer </li>
   <li>  Develop arts and engineering funding proposals alongside MOCO organizers to support the artist’s planning, production and exhibition as well as synergistic conference activities </li>
   <li>  Teach classes to students and community members </li>
   <li>  Share their working process with conference goers </li>
   </ul>

   <p>The format of the residency, including length of stay/duration/frequency is flexible, although we anticipate the artist working with MOCO organizers for synergistic programming and grant writing leading up to the conference and completing three ~week-long site-visits to Columbia College in Spring, Summer, and Fall 2021. Artists are encouraged to propose a plan specific to the project, taking into consideration working with stakeholders and work-in-progress showing. If you are interested in this position, please send your resume and a prepared short essay to Amy LaViers and Kristin Carlson (alaviers@illinois.edu and kacarl1@ilstu.edu), including the following elements: </p>
   <ul>
   <li>  A bit about your background and prior experiences</li>
   <li>  A motivating question(s) you propose to center your work for MOCO around</li>
   <li>  Mediums and processes you’ll use to create this work</li>
   </ul>

     <p>Applications are accepted until an AiR is announced.  Please write to Amy LaViers and Kristin Carlson with any questions at alaviers@illinois.edu and kacarl1@ilstu.edu.  This residency is supported by MOCO and its industrial sponsors as well as the Conference on Research on Choreographic Interfaces (CRCI), which is providing advisory and programmatic support, including development of best-practices and funding for this position, and Zoi Arts, which is providing design of and support for outreach experiences for the Chicago public alongside the AiR.</p>
